# Imagify: AI Image Generator
### FSD Project

Imagify: AI Image Generator is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack that converts user text prompts into images through integration with image generation APIs. The system provides a simple interface for entering prompts and displays the generated outputs in a user’s gallery. Each image is stored with associated tags, enabling efficient search and retrieval.

The application demonstrates core concepts of web development, including frontend–backend communication, API integration, database persistence, and search functionality. By combining text input, image generation, and tag-based search, Imagify offers a complete implementation of an end-to-end interactive application.
